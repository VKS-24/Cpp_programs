/*You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in ascending order. You are also given an integer 'target'.

Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. Otherwise, return -1.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 7 ‘target’ = 3
‘A’ = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45]

Output: 1

Explanation: For A = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45],
The index of element '3' is 1.
Hence, the answer is '1'.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 'N', which denotes the size of the array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.

The third line contains the value of 'target' to be searched for in the array/list.
Output Format :
Return the index at which 'target' is present for each test case, -1 otherwise.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= target <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
7
1 3 7 9 11 12 45
3
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation of sample output 1:
For nums = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45],
The index of element '3' is 1.
Hence, the answer is '1'.
Sample Input 2:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
9
Sample Output 2:
-1
Explanation of sample output 2:
For nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
Element '9' doesn't exist.
Hence, the answer is '-1'.*/
